# Docker_Loki

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grafana/loki/v3.4.1/production/docker-compose.yaml -O docker-compose.yaml
https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/setup/install/docker/

This starts grafana as well. We already have grafana running in another compose.
That is why I have made a loki-only compose to test.
